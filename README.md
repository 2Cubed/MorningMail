# MorningMail
Little mail script to email you with the weather of your area. In Python!

# Usage

Run the script. It should close the first time it's ran. Then, open the `config.json` file, and fill in all of the sections. Then, run the script again, and you should see an email in the recipient's inbox if it was done correctly!

# Obtaining an API key

Go to " http://openweathermap.org/api " and sign up to get the API key.

I would recommend putting this script in a chron job. That's what I'm doing currently.
