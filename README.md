# MorningMail
Little mail script to email you with the weather of your area. In Python!

# Usage

Open main.py, and change the recipient, sender, subject(optional), state, city, and API key. You can also set "celcius" to true if you require that.

# Obtaining an API key

Go to " http://openweathermap.org/api " and sign up for the API key.

# Example

I would recommend putting this script in a chron job. That's what I'm doing currently.
